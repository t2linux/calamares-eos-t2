### Documentation on why we are using this modified versions will follow here:
Python modules (it is implemented in C++ and injected into the Python
environment by Calamares).


1. **copy_kernel:** *unused* now a shellprocess: [shellprocess_ck.conf](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/EndeavourOS-calamares/blob/main/calamares/modules/shellprocess_ck.conf)
Use of this kind of module is **not** recommended. Use *shellprocess*
instead, which is more configurable.

2. **eos_script:** This module is unique to EndeavourOS, and used to integrate the scripts we need to create EndeavourOS and mainly Archlinux specific configurations.
passed to the shell -- remember to quote it properly in YAML. It is generally
easier to have multiple instances). There is no configuration outside
of the module-descriptor. The *command* undergoes Calamares variable-
expansion (e.g. replacing `${ROOT}` by the target of the installation).
See *shellprocess* documentation for details.

Optional keys are *timeout* and *chroot*.

3. **fstab** and ***mount:** We use the fstab and mount modules from Calamares 3.3. There are a couple of big advantages:
   * Mount options are now set prior to installation so things like compression are applied to the install itself
   * You can now have separate options for both SSDs and HDDs

5. **packages:** We are using a custom version of the packages module to provide feedback to the user during the package installation process

6. **pacstrap:** This module is unique to EndeavourOS, and the pure online install method to be close to arch we are using pacstrap for the initial system creation.

7. **userpkglist:** This module is unique to EndeavourOS, and used on the implementation for users to add a list of packages that will get installed in addition to the system on install process. 

8. **partition:** This module has been modified to support custom paritioning for ARM. The files that are changed are `core/PartUtils.cpp` and `core/PartitionActions.cpp`. The first file is changed to force EFI mode on ARM installs and the second file is changed to set 16 MiB empty space at the beginning of parition instead of 2 MiB.

9. **eos-arm:** This modules sets a globalstorage variable signifying that the install is ARM and we can use this variable in other modules.
